## CONVERSATION
* W: Can you lend me a pen? 
* M: Sure. Here you go. Why would you want a pen when we’re flying? 
* W: Oh, I want to fill the landing card beforehand. 
* M: Oh, you are not an American citizen? 
* W: Yeah, I’m from Taiwan. American citizens don’t have to fill in these cards right?

* W: How can I get one?
