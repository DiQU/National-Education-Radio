## CONVERSATION
* W: Look, I really like your stuff. It’s just that you sell them way too expensively. You should at least cut the price by half before I’ll consider buying them. 
* M: Stacy, give the shopkeeper a break. the rental rate in this area is quite impossible for him to sell goods at too low a price. 
* W: Still, he should give me a discount. 
* M: Let’s just go around for a bit more and see if there’s cheaper stuff elsewhere.
